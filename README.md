# Project Spyn, Team 3

This project was for the Spring 2024 session of FSE 100: Introduction to Engineering. The goal of
the project was to simulate an autonomous vehicle picking up a handicapped person by building 
a robot using the Lego EV3 kit and writing software for it in MATLAB that would enable it
to navigate a maze, pick up a cardboard cutout, and navigate to another section of the maze 
autonomously, while stopping at "red lights" marked by red colored squares. Except for when a human 
driver controlled the robot enabling it to pick up and put down the cardboard cutout, the robot 
autonomously navigated the maze, safely transporting the cardboard cutout to the opposite side.

On our grading sheet, we earned full credit in all categories:
